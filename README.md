# random-kana
Kana generator for practising Hiragana/Katakana.

This command line program is made in Rust. It generates a user specified amount of kana (spelled in latin symbols) which then can be used to practise the writing in Hiragana and/or Katakana symbols. The amount of generated kana can be specified by typing the number as the first argument after ```.\randomkana```
(note that typing 0 or any negative number will result in no symbol printed)

# Example

```.\randomkana 10```
